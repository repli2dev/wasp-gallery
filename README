defaultGallery: '',		// Default gallery to load (default is no gallery)
defaultLanguage: 'en',	// Language used in current frontend
showGalleries: true, 	// Shows gallery list
showGalleryHeading: true, // Shows gallery heading
slideshowSpeed: 3500	// Time between image swaps



5. CUSTOMIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* In file inc/config.neon you can set interesting options:
		- gallery.dir = "galleries" ; directory with galleries
		- gallery.cache = "cache" ; directory with thumbnails
		- gallery.width = 160 ; width of thumbnail in pixels
		- gallery.height = 140 ; height of thumbnail in pixels
	* PHP code is mostly in index.php and inc/function.php and it use
	  advantages of Nette framework (http://nette.org)
	* Photo presentation uses colorbox and jquery
	  http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/


6. TRANSLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Currently there are these translations:
		* English
		* Czech

	However creating own is very simply:
		1. Copy inc/lang/cs.php to inc/lang/<YOUR-LANG>.php
		2. Translate all values from second column (do not touch keys!)
		   e.g. "key" => "values",
		3. Send it to me, or make pull request on GitHub, so I can attach it to the next version ;-)
