5. TRANSLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Currently there are these translations:
		* English
		* Czech

	However creating own is very simply:
		1. Copy inc/lang/en.php to inc/lang/<YOUR-LANG>.php
		2. Translate all values from second column (do not touch keys!)
		   e.g. "key" => "values",
		3. In inc/config.ini set variable.lang = <YOUR-LANG>
		4. Send it to me, so I can attach it to the next version ;-)
